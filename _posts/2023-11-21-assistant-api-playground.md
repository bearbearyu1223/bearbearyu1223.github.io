## TL;DR
![page_cover](/assets/picture/2023_11_21_assistant_api_playground/cropped_image.png)

 OpenAI unveiled its [Assistant API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) during its very first developer conference-[OpenAI DevDay](https://devday.openai.com/). This marked a significant addition to the suite of tools and models available for building conversational AI, a domain in which I've been actively engaged. 
 
 Although I have used other frameworks, tools and models to build customized Assistant in the past (check out my previous posts  [Food QnA Chatbot : Help Answer Food Related Questions from Your Own Cookbook](https://bearbearyu1223.github.io/chatbot/2023/07/31/food-qna-on-server-llm.html) and [Build On-Device QnA with LangChain and Llama2](https://bearbearyu1223.github.io/chatbot/2023/08/14/food-qna-on-device-llm.html)), intrigued by the new capabilities of the Assistant API, I decided to integrate it into a new project. This sample project is a refreshed demonstration of a simple Cooking Assistant, leveraging not only the Assistant API but also incorporating additional functionalities such as [Text-to-Speech](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech) and [Image Generation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images?context=node), showcasing a holistic approach to building conversational AI systems with only a few lines of code.

Ready to unleash your creativity? Start building your own generative AI-powered experience today, join the forefront of AI innovation, and let us make AI for everyone! 

## Set Up the Dev Enviroment 
* Step 1: Git clone the sample project from [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/bearbearyu1223/assistant_api_playground). 
* Step 2: Create a venv
```
python3 -m venv cooking_assistant
```
* Step 3: Under the project root, active the venv you have just created,
```
source cooking_assistant/bin/activate
```
* Step 4: Installed the required libaries in the venv 
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
* Step 5: create an `.env` file under your project root and add your Open AI API Key as following: 
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=<Your API KEY>
```

## Run the Application 
You can play with the project in an interactive mode by entering a query related to food preparation and cooking via:
```
python main.py
```
and simply press `Ctrl + C` to exit the program. See a sample converstation created from this application below.
