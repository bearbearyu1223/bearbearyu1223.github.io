## Introduction

Itâ€™s been a while since my last blog post about my generative AI learning journey (January 1, 2024). My day job has demanded significant time and energy, but I donâ€™t want that to derail my passion and curiosity for deep-diving into this field.

This week, I had a realization: instead of endlessly reflecting, thinking, or planning, itâ€™s time to act. Even with just one hour of focused study after work each day, I can make meaningful progress by year-end.

Iâ€™ve decided to tackle Stanfordâ€™s [**CS336: Language Modeling from Scratch**](https://stanford-cs336.github.io/spring2025/) at my own pace. Iâ€™m grateful that Stanford makes their [**Lecture Videos**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQ3fZ1sAqXI&list=PLoROMvodv4rOY23Y0BoGoBGgQ1zmU_MT_&ab_channel=StanfordOnline), [**Lecture Notes & Assignments**](https://github.com/stanford-cs336) freely available onlineâ€”a perfect fit for someone like me who canâ€™t commit to fixed class schedules but still craves structured learning.

To give back to the community, Iâ€™ll document and share my learning notes as I progress. Iâ€™m curious to see how much I can accomplish by dedicating just an hour a day (or ~10 hours per week) through the end of the year. Can I complete all the lectures and assignments? I know Iâ€™ll move slowly, but Iâ€™m excited to test my consistency and see whatâ€™s possible.

This first post covers **setting up the local development environment**â€”a small but necessary step to begin engaging with the lecture materials.


## Setting Up the Local Dev Environment

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Git, Python 3.11, and Node.js installed on your system. Youâ€™ll also need [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv), a fast Python package manager.


### Step 1: Clone the CS336 Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stanford-cs336/spring2025-lectures
cd spring2025-lectures
```


### Step 2: Set Up Python Virtual Environment with UV

Install `uv` (if not already installed):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Create a virtual environment using Python 3.11:

```bash
uv venv --python=3.11
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```


### Step 3: Install Python Dependencies

> ðŸ’¡ Note: I'm using a MacBook Pro (M4). The `triton` package doesn't support Apple Silicon, so I excluded it during the initial setup.  
> More info: [Triton GitHub](https://github.com/triton-lang/triton)

```bash
grep -v "triton" requirements.txt > requirements_no_triton.txt
uv pip install -r requirements_no_triton.txt
```


### Step 4: Generate Executable Lecture Content

Compile a lecture:

```bash
python execute.py -m lecture_01
```

This will generate a trace file at:

```
var/traces/lecture_01.json
```


### Step 5: Build the Local React Web App to View Lectures

Install Node.js if needed:

```bash
brew install node
```

Then build and serve the trace viewer:

```bash
cd trace-viewer
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the viewer in your browser:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>?trace=var/traces/lecture_01.json
```

It should be something like ![this](/assets/picture/2025_07_20_cs336_note_get_started/cs336_lecture_view.png).


Then enjoy going through the lecture notes!
