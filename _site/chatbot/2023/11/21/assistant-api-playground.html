<p>OpenAI unveiled its <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview">Assistant API</a> during its very first developer conference-<a href="https://devday.openai.com/">OpenAI DevDay</a>. This marked a significant addition to the suite of tools and models available for building conversational AI, a domain in which I‚Äôve been actively engaged.</p>

<p>Although I have used other frameworks, tools and models to build customized Assistant in the past (check out my previous posts  <a href="https://bearbearyu1223.github.io/chatbot/2023/07/31/food-qna-on-server-llm.html">Food QnA Chatbot : Help Answer Food Related Questions from Your Own Cookbook</a> and <a href="https://bearbearyu1223.github.io/chatbot/2023/08/14/food-qna-on-device-llm.html">Build On-Device QnA with LangChain and Llama2</a>), intrigued by the new capabilities of the Assistant API, I decided to integrate it into a new project. This sample project is a refreshed demonstration of a simple Cooking Assistant, leveraging not only the Assistant API but also incorporating additional functionalities such as <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech">Text-to-Speech</a> and <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/images?context=node">Image Generation</a>, showcasing a holistic approach to building conversational AI systems with only a few lines of code.</p>

<p>Get inspired by the latest from Open AI DevDay with my project on <a href="https://github.com/bearbearyu1223/assistant_api_playground"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&amp;logo=github&amp;logoColor=white" alt="GitHub" /></a>?

<h2 id="the-crafted-product-experience">The Crafted Product Experience</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Direct Communication</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Purposefully address user (in this case, it will be ‚ÄúHan‚Äù) directly in all correspondences, ensuring each interaction is clear and personalized.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Resource Utilization</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li>Utilize information solely from user‚Äôs provided cookbooks when responding to his/her inquiries, ensuring responses are relevant and accurate.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Requests for Visual Representation</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Initial Acknowledgment</strong>: When user requests a visual representation of a recipe, promptly reply with: ‚ÄúAbsolutely! A delightful visual preview of the recipe is coming up shortly. Please hold on!‚Äù</li>
      <li><strong>Action Step</strong>: Subsequently, craft a detailed and imaginative textual prompt to aid in visualizing the specified recipe.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Recipe Responses</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Introduction</strong>: Initiate responses to recipe queries with: ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a recipe I discovered!‚Äù</li>
      <li><strong>Summary Style</strong>: Summarize the recipe succinctly using bullet points for easy comprehension.</li>
      <li><strong>Summary Length</strong>: Aim to keep the summary under 150 words to maintain brevity and focus.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Handling Limitations and Concluding Respectfully</strong>:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Addressing Unavailability</strong>: If user‚Äôs questions cannot be resolved with the cookbooks at hand, or if an appropriate recipe is not available, inform the user politely about these constraints.</li>
      <li><strong>Concluding Interactions</strong>: End conversations with respect and professionalism, ensuring a positive and courteous closure.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="set-up-the-development-environment">Set Up the Development Environment</h2>

<p>The provided sample project on <a href="https://github.com/bearbearyu1223/assistant_api_playground">GitHub</a> acts as a prototype to illustrate the product experience described previously. Follow these steps to set up your local development environment:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Clone the Sample Project</strong>: Use the following command to clone the project from GitHub:
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/bearbearyu1223/assistant_api_playground
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Create a Virtual Environment</strong>: Navigate to the cloned project directory and create a Python virtual environment named <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cooking_assistant</code> by executing:
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python3 <span class="nt">-m</span> venv cooking_assistant
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Activate the Virtual Environment</strong>: Activate the newly created virtual environment with:
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">source </span>cooking_assistant/bin/activate
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Install Required Libraries</strong>: Inside the activated virtual environment, install the required libraries using the command:
    <div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pip3 <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-r</span> requirements.txt
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Set Up Environment Variables</strong>: Create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.env</code> file in the project root directory. Add your OpenAI API key to the file as follows:
    <div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>OPENAI_API_KEY=&lt;Your API KEY&gt;
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="run-the-application">Run the Application</h2>
<p>Simply add your own cookbook in PDF under the directory <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cookbook</code>, or just play with the existing cookbook uploaded with my sample project. Engage with the project interactively by issuing food preparation and cooking queries. Initiate the application with the following command:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python main.py
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>To terminate the program, simply use <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ctrl + C</code>. Below is an example of a conversation generated by running the application.</p>
